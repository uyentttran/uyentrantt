👋 **Welcome**!

I'm Uyên, a researcher interested in sustainable agriculture and aquaculture development.


🌱 Before 2019, I worked across Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar, assessing value chains in coffee, tea, fruits, and vegetables — with different focuses on water-saving irrigation, organic farming, and agrochemical traceability.


📍 Since 2019, I’ve been based in Germany, where I completed a M.Sc. in Agricultural Science & Resource Management in the Tropics and Subtropics. Currently, I’m pursuing a PhD in Agricultural Economics at the University of Bonn.
